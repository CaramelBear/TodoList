# TodoList
<h1>TodoList App</h1>

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Vue.JS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
</ul>

<p>Functionalities include adding to the todolist by pressing the "add"
button or by just pressing the "enter" key on the keyboard</p>

</br>

<p>With each todo item that is generated, a delete button is dynamically
created to also delete that specific list item</p>

</br>
<p>A Delete All button exists to purge all existing todos in the list</p>

</br>
<p>There is a limit of 5 todos being entered to the list</p>

</br>
<p>This was more of an experimentation project for using Vue.JS for the first time
</p>
